Community AddOn f√ºr [REDAXO 4](http://www.redaxo.org/) with new plugin auth_simplesamlphp

[SimpleSAMLphp](http://www.simplesamlphp.org/) can act as a service 
provider for authentification against SAML 2.0, Shibboleth 1.3, 
A-Select, CAS, OpenID, WS-Federation and OAuth identity protocols.

This plugin integrates the SimpleSAMLphp login routines into the 
REDAXO Community AddOn and uses code from the auth_facebook plugin.

The plugin is work in progress: modules for login and logout are missing
and the plugin expects an attribute array from a Shibboleth DFN-AII server.
